# Deferred Ideas for Manus AI Memory Layer

This document contains ideas that are valuable for the Manus AI memory layer but are not immediately integrated into the current blueprint (Version 1.1). These ideas will be revisited for future versions and continuous improvement.

## Ideas Deferred from Pasted Content 3

### Design Patterns (High-Level Concepts - Already Integrated into Blueprint)

### Schema Add-Ons (migration v2.1.sql)

#### Event-stream memory with typed events (`event` table)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This aligns perfectly with the vision of a human-like memory that learns from every interaction. It provides a structured way to log all system activities, which is crucial for self-debugging and learning.

#### RACI alignment guard (`raci` table)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This directly addresses the need for preventing 


value-drift and ensuring that the AI's actions are aligned with the user's intentions. It's a proactive approach to safety and control.

#### Domain knowledge APIs (`knowledge_api` table)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This is a significant step towards a more intelligent and efficient RAG system. Instead of relying solely on generic web searches, the AI can tap into domain-specific knowledge sources, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.

### Credit-Gated Self-Reflection (`memory/reflection.py`)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This is a practical implementation of the credit-aware philosophy. It allows for self-reflection without the risk of overspending tokens, which is a key constraint.

### RACI Gatekeeper (`memory/guard.py`)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This is the implementation of the RACI table. It's a crucial component for ensuring that the AI's actions are approved and aligned with the user's preferences.

### Knowledge-API Auto-Injector (`memory/know.py`)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This is the implementation of the `knowledge_api` table. It's a key feature for improving the quality of the AI's responses by leveraging domain-specific knowledge.

### Confidence Footer (`src/format.py`)
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** This provides a simple yet effective way for the user to gauge the AI's confidence in its responses. It's a valuable feature for building trust and transparency.

### Implementation Checklist and One-Command Delta
- **Reason for inclusion in v1.1:** These are practical steps for implementing the new features. They provide a clear roadmap and a simplified setup process, which is in line with the goal of creating a user-friendly and maintainable system.
