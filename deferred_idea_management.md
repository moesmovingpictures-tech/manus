# Formalized Process for Managing and Reminding About Deferred Ideas

## Introduction

To ensure that valuable ideas are not lost and can be revisited at the appropriate time, a formalized process for managing and reminding about deferred ideas is crucial. This process will complement the incremental blueprint update mechanism by providing a structured way to handle concepts that are not immediately integrated into the current version. The `future_ideas.md` file will serve as the primary repository for these deferred ideas, but the management process will be more dynamic and proactive than simple file storage.

## Principles of Deferred Idea Management

1.  **Preservation of Value:** Every idea, even if deferred, is considered valuable. The management process will ensure that these ideas are preserved, along with their context and rationale for deferral.

2.  **Contextual Relevance:** The system will strive to reintroduce deferred ideas at moments when they are most relevant to the current conversation or task, maximizing their potential impact.

3.  **Proactive Reminders:** Instead of passively waiting for the user to remember deferred ideas, the system will proactively remind the user about them, especially those that are high-priority or have become more feasible over time.

4.  **Dynamic Re-evaluation:** Deferred ideas will not be static. They will be periodically re-evaluated based on new information, changes in system capabilities, and evolving user needs.

5.  **Transparency and User Control:** The user will always have visibility into the list of deferred ideas and will have the final say on whether to incorporate them into the active blueprint.

## The Deferred Idea Management Lifecycle

The management of deferred ideas will follow a lifecycle that ensures they are captured, stored, re-evaluated, and eventually either integrated or archived.

### 1. Idea Deferral and Storage

This is the initial step where an idea is identified as a candidate for deferral.

*   **Triggers for Deferral:**
    *   **High Complexity:** Ideas that are too complex for incremental implementation in the current version.
    *   **Low Priority:** Ideas that are deemed less critical than those currently in the blueprint.
    *   **External Dependencies:** Ideas that depend on future technological advancements or external system changes.
    *   **Resource Constraints:** Ideas that are too resource-intensive (e.g., high token cost, significant computational power) for the current budget or environment.
    *   **User Directive:** The user may explicitly request to defer an idea.

*   **Structured Storage in `future_ideas.md`:** When an idea is deferred, it will be added to `future_ideas.md` with the following structured information:
    *   **Idea Title:** A concise and descriptive title for the idea.
    *   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the idea, its purpose, and its potential benefits.
    *   **Rationale for Deferral:** A clear explanation of why the idea was deferred (e.g., "High complexity, requires further research on X," "Low priority compared to Y," "Awaiting availability of Z technology").
    *   **Source:** The origin of the idea (e.g., user input from a specific date, internal reflection, error log entry).
    *   **Priority Level:** A preliminary priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to guide future re-evaluation.
    *   **Dependencies:** Any known dependencies on other ideas or system changes.
    *   **Estimated Cost (if applicable):** A rough estimate of the token or computational cost.

### 2. Periodic Re-evaluation and Prioritization

Deferred ideas will not be left to stagnate. The system will periodically re-evaluate them.

*   **Scheduled Reviews:** The system will schedule regular reviews of `future_ideas.md`. The frequency of these reviews can be configured (e.g., weekly, monthly) or triggered by specific events (e.g., a major system upgrade, a significant increase in token budget).

*   **Re-evaluation Criteria:** During a review, each deferred idea will be re-evaluated against the following criteria:
    *   **Current System Capabilities:** Have there been any changes to the system that now make this idea more feasible?
    *   **Evolving User Needs:** Has the user expressed new needs or priorities that align with this deferred idea?
    *   **Changes in Dependencies:** Have any external dependencies been resolved?
    *   **Updated Priority:** Based on the above, should the priority of the idea be adjusted?

*   **Automated Reporting:** After each review cycle, the system can generate a summary report for the user, highlighting any changes in priority or feasibility of deferred ideas.

### 3. Contextual Reminders and Proactive Suggestions

This is the core of the proactive reminder mechanism.

*   **Embedding-Based Retrieval:** The system will continuously compare the vector embeddings of the current conversation (`conv_turn`) with the embeddings of deferred ideas stored in `future_ideas.md` (or a dedicated database). If a high degree of semantic similarity is detected, it will trigger a reminder.

*   **Intelligent Reminder Generation:** When a relevant deferred idea is identified, the system will generate a natural language reminder for the user. This reminder will be context-aware and non-intrusive. For example:
    *   "I recall we discussed the idea of [Deferred Idea Title] a while ago. Given our current conversation about [Current Topic], it seems like it might be relevant now. Would you like to reconsider it for the next blueprint update?"
    *   "I've noticed a recurring pattern in our conversations related to [Theme]. This reminds me of a deferred idea to implement [Feature]. I believe it could help address this. Shall I add it to the blueprint for Version X.X?"

*   **User-Controlled Reminders:** The user will have control over the frequency and verbosity of these reminders. They can choose to be reminded more or less often, or to disable reminders for specific ideas.

### 4. Idea Integration or Archiving

Based on user feedback and re-evaluation, a deferred idea can have one of two outcomes:

*   **Integration into Blueprint:** If the user approves the integration of a deferred idea, it will be moved from `future_ideas.md` to the active `blueprint_vX.X.md` and will follow the standard incremental update process. The rationale for its integration will be documented.

*   **Archiving:** If an idea is deemed no longer relevant or feasible, it will be moved to a separate archive file. This ensures that the `future_ideas.md` file remains a clean and actionable list, while still preserving a historical record of all considered ideas.

## Integration with Self-Management Prompt

The formalized process for managing deferred ideas will be explicitly mentioned in the `self_management_prompt.md` file. This will serve as a directive for me to:

*   **Actively manage the `future_ideas.md` file.**
*   **Periodically re-evaluate deferred ideas.**
*   **Proactively remind the user about relevant deferred ideas.**
*   **Seek user approval before integrating deferred ideas into the active blueprint.**

By implementing this formalized process, the Manus AI memory layer will not only capture and store valuable ideas but will also ensure that they are revisited and reconsidered at the most opportune moments, creating a truly dynamic and intelligent system for continuous improvement.
